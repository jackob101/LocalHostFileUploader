# Local File Uploader

As the name suggests, this project is all about sending and downloading files from local server. This project could be
easily replaced by something like **ftp**, but I wanted to learn few things, and in my experience, the best way to learn
is to just work on projects.

## Current Functionality

- Send files to local server
- Download files from local server
- Rename files
- Create new directories

## What I'm planning to add

- [ ] Add preview of files
- [ ] Add functionality to change permissions
- [ ] Set up https (Currently there is https implemented ,but I turned it off because it was self-signed and caused
  trouble )
- [ ] Add some sort of simple text editor to quickly create basic notes and upload it to server(in my case my pc)
- [ ] Maybe rework UI. I'm not sure yet
